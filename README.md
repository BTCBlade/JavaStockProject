Cartman: Casa Bonita is my favorite place in the whole world, I'll just die if you don't take me. Please. 
Kyle: Sorry, my mind is made up. 
Cartman: Well fuck you, Kyle! I don't wanna go to your faggy birthday party anyway! I'd rather hang out at home than have to be around you and your Jew mom for a day. Kiss my balls, asshole!

Cartman: Dude, I totally didn't mean that, Kyle. I really want to go to Casa Bonita. I'm sorry we had that fight just now, you know, I mean I said some things, you said some things but, I think we've moved past it. 
Kyle: I'm not inviting you to Casa Bonita. 
Cartman: Well FUCK YOU, Kyle! I hope you die! I hope you fucking die!
